## üöÄ Quick Demo Commands

### Test All Health Endpoints
```powershell
# PowerShell commands for Windows
curl http://localhost:8081/health  # Student Service
curl http://localhost:8082/health  # Teacher Service  
curl http://localhost:8083/health  # Academic Service
curl http://localhost:8084/health  # Achievement Service

# Expected response for all services:
# {"database":"couchbase-connected","service":"[service-name]","status":"healthy"}
```

### Health Check PowerShell Script
