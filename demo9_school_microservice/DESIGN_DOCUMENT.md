### Service Architecture Principles

#### 1. Domain-Oriented Design
Each microservice owns a specific business domain:
- **Students Service**: Student enrollment, profiles, and lifecycle management
- **Teachers Service**: Faculty management, assignments, and profiles
- **Classes Service**: Course management, scheduling, and enrollment
- **Academics Service**: Grade management, assessments, and academic records
- **Achievements Service**: Awards, recognitions, and achievement tracking

#### 2. Bounded Contexts
- Each service maintains its own data model and business logic
- Inter-service communication through well-defined APIs
- Database-per-service pattern with shared Couchbase cluster
- Eventual consistency model for cross-service data

#### 3. Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Go 1.21 (performance, concurrency, cloud-native support)
- **Database**: Couchbase Community 7.2.0 (JSON document store, scalability)
- **Container Runtime**: Docker with distroless/Alpine base images
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes with Helm 3.x
- **HTTP Framework**: Gorilla Mux (routing, middleware support)

## Data Architecture

### Database Design

#### Couchbase NoSQL Strategy
- **Document-based storage**: Natural fit for complex nested data structures
- **Horizontal scalability**: Built-in clustering and replication
- **JSON-native**: Direct mapping from Go structs to database documents
- **N1QL queries**: SQL-like query language for complex operations

#### Data Organization
```
Bucket: school
├── Collections:
│   ├── students/
│   ├── teachers/
│   ├── classes/
│   ├── academics/
│   └── achievements/
```

#### Key Design Patterns
- **Document keys**: Service-specific prefixes (STU_, TCH_, CLS_, ACD_, ACH_)
- **Timestamp-based IDs**: Ensures uniqueness and provides creation order
- **Embedded references**: Foreign key relationships stored as string references
- **Audit fields**: CreatedAt and UpdatedAt timestamps for all entities

### Data Consistency Model

#### Within Service Boundaries
- **ACID compliance**: Strong consistency within single service operations
- **Transaction support**: Couchbase ACID transactions for multi-document operations
- **Optimistic locking**: Using document CAS (Compare-And-Swap) values

#### Cross-Service Consistency
- **Eventual consistency**: Asynchronous propagation of reference data changes
- **Compensation patterns**: Rollback mechanisms for failed cross-service operations
- **Reference integrity**: Application-level foreign key validation

## Infrastructure Design

### Containerization Strategy

#### Docker Multi-Stage Builds
```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build environment
FROM golang:1.21-alpine AS builder
# ... build process ...

# Stage 2: Runtime environment  
FROM alpine:3.18
# ... minimal runtime setup ...
```
