## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Docker Desktop
- Docker Compose
- Git (for cloning the repository)

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Clone and Navigate to Project

```powershell
# If you haven't already, navigate to the project directory
cd "d:\demo\schoolmgmt"
```

### Step 2: Build and Start Services

```powershell
# Build and start all services with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build -d
```

This command will:
- Build all microservices from source
- Start Couchbase database
- Start all microservices
- Configure networking between services

### Step 3: Verify Services are Running

```powershell
# Check status of all containers
docker-compose ps

# Check logs for any issues
docker-compose logs -f
```

Expected output should show all services as "Up" and healthy.

### Step 4: Wait for Database Initialization

Couchbase needs time to initialize. Wait for about 2-3 minutes, then check:

```powershell
# Check Couchbase health
curl http://localhost:8091/pools
```

### Step 5: Configure Couchbase (First Time Setup)

1. Open Couchbase Admin Console: http://localhost:8091
2. Click "Setup New Cluster"
3. Set admin credentials:
   - Username: `Administrator`
   - Password: `password123`
4. Accept default settings and finish setup
5. Create buckets for each service:
   - `students`
   - `teachers` 
   - `academics`
   - `achievements`

### Step 6: Verify API Gateway

```powershell
# Test API Gateway health
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "api-gateway",
  "services": {
    "student": "http://student-service:8081",
    "teacher": "http://teacher-service:8082", 
    "academic": "http://academic-service:8083",
    "achievement": "http://achievement-service:8084"
  }
}
```

### Step 7: Test Individual Services

```powershell
# Test Student Service
curl http://localhost:8081/health

# Test Teacher Service  
curl http://localhost:8082/health

# Test Academic Service
curl http://localhost:8083/health

# Test Achievement Service
curl http://localhost:8084/health
```

## API Usage Examples

    "category": "academic", 
    "level": "school",
    "awarded_date": "2024-08-05T00:00:00Z",
    "points": 50
  }'
```

## Service Endpoints

### API Gateway (Port 8080)
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET,POST,PUT,DELETE /api/v1/students/*` - Student operations
- `GET,POST,PUT,DELETE /api/v1/teachers/*` - Teacher operations  
- `GET,POST,PUT,DELETE /api/v1/academics/*` - Academic operations
- `GET,POST,PUT,DELETE /api/v1/achievements/*` - Achievement operations

### Individual Services
Each service also exposes direct endpoints on their respective ports (8081-8084).

## Configuration

Services can be configured via environment variables:

- `PORT` - Service port (default varies by service)
- `COUCHBASE_HOST` - Couchbase host (default: localhost)
- `COUCHBASE_USERNAME` - Database username (default: Administrator)
- `COUCHBASE_PASSWORD` - Database password (default: password123)
- `COUCHBASE_BUCKET` - Bucket name (varies by service)

## Monitoring and Logs

### View logs from all services:
```powershell
docker-compose logs -f
```

### View logs from specific service:
```powershell
docker-compose logs -f student-service
docker-compose logs -f api-gateway
```

### Monitor resource usage:
```powershell
docker stats
```

## Stopping the Services

```powershell
# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove volumes (includes database data)
docker-compose down -v
```

## Troubleshooting

### Services not starting:
1. Check Docker Desktop is running
2. Verify ports 8080-8084 and 8091-8096 are not in use
3. Check Docker Compose logs for errors

### Couchbase connection issues:
1. Wait for Couchbase to fully initialize (2-3 minutes)
2. Verify Couchbase admin console is accessible
3. Ensure buckets are created with correct names

### API calls failing:
1. Verify all services are healthy via health endpoints
2. Check service logs for errors
3. Ensure request format matches API specification

## Performance Considerations

- The system is designed to handle ~200 TPS during peak hours
- Couchbase provides horizontal scalability
- Services can be individually scaled based on load
- API Gateway provides load balancing capabilities

## Future Enhancements

- Authentication and authorization
- Real-time notifications
- File upload capabilities for certificates
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Mobile app integration
- Kubernetes deployment manifests

## Contributing
